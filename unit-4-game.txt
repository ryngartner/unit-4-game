Hi Steven,


Thank you for taking the time to sit down with me today.  I appreciate your understanding about my current workload.  After the holidays are over my schedule will clear-up dramatically.  I also appreciate you giving me the opportunity to turn in my Crystal Collector game mid-january. 
I'm really enjoying your class and am looking forward to the future.

Thanks again,

Ryan
